# Multi-level-graph-embedding-with-GAE

(work in progress) <br>
Using Metis to coarsen the target graph, then using Graph auto encoder to generate node embedding, the use refinement to re-assign embedding at fine level nodes

Coarsen Pubmed with GAE auto encoder embedding , plotted with T-SNE , coarse size is around 500 node compare to orginal 20,000 node

refinment embedding to the entire graph
